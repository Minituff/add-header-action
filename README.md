## Usage
This action is ready to go out of the box. To change the header, see the [Customization](#customization) section.


```yml
name: Add header

jobs:
  build:
    name: Add headers
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} # (only needed for private repos)
    
    - name: Add header action step
      uses: minituff/add-header-action@v1
      id: add-header-action
      with:
        dry-run: false # Don't make any changes, but log what *would* change.
        verbose: false # Extra logging to help you debug.

    - name: Commit and Push changes back to repo
      uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v5
```
## Customization
Create a `.headerrc.yml` file in either the `.github` **or** *root* diretory of your project.

```console
ðŸ“¦root
 â”£ ðŸ“‚.github
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚workflows
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œadd-header-workflow.yml
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ.headerrc.yml             # <---- Either here
 â”— ðŸ“œ.gitignore

ðŸ“¦root
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.headerrc.yml               # <---- Or here
 â”— ðŸ“œ.gitignore
```

This action loads default values  from the [headerrc-default.yml](/headerrc-default.yml) <small>(this is built into the action)</small>, then merges them with the values from the [.headerrc.yml](/.github/.headerrc.yml) file from your repo.

The following are a list of configurable options in the `.headerrc.yml`:

```yaml
# Decide the method for choosing which files to add headers to.
# opt-out  =  all files will be selected unless the file path matches untracked_files.
# opt-in   =   no files will be selected unless the file path matches anything in tracked_files.
file_mode: opt-out

# A list of regex used to match file paths to receive the header. (opt-in mode only)
tracked_files: 
  - ^README.md$

# A list of regex used to match file paths to be skipped. (opt-in mode only)
# All file paths *not* matched will receive a header.
untracked_files:
  - app/
  - ^Dockerfile$

# Automatically add everything in the .gitignore file into the untracked_files section.
# This can save lots of time because most of these files can be ignored.  (opt-in mode only)
untrack_gitignore: true # Default = true

use_default_file_settings: true # Default = true

# The header to be added. Do not add the comment (#, //) here, see the file_associations section for that.
